# Duration.Finance

**A duration-centric market making venue for fully-collateralized options on Base**

Duration.Finance revolutionizes options trading by transforming it into a **duration marketplace** where LPs compete on daily yield rates and takers choose optimal lock periods.

## üéØ Core Innovation: Duration Market Making

Unlike traditional options focused on strike prices, Duration.Finance creates a **duration-first marketplace** where:

- **LPs set daily rates**: Compete on daily premium rates across duration ranges
- **Takers choose duration**: Select optimal lock periods for their strategies  
- **Market price strikes**: Strike prices set to current market when taken
- **Yield transparency**: Real-time LP yield calculations drive competition

```
Traditional Options:  Fixed strike ‚Üí Variable premium by time
Duration.Finance:     Market strike ‚Üí Daily rate √ó chosen duration
```

## üîß Option Settlement Mechanics

### CALL Options (Bullish - expect price to rise)
**At Taking:**
- Contract receives WETH collateral from LP
- Strike price locked at current market price
- Premium paid to LP immediately

**At Exercise (if price rose above strike):**
- Contract sells WETH at current higher price via 1inch
- Profit (current price - strike price) √ó amount ‚Üí Option holder
- Strike price equivalent in USDC ‚Üí LP (collateral provider)

### PUT Options (Bearish - expect price to drop)
**At Taking:**
- Contract receives WETH collateral from LP
- **Contract immediately sells WETH ‚Üí USDC** at strike price via 1inch
- Contract holds USDC from sale + premium already paid to LP

**At Exercise (if price dropped below strike):**
- Contract buys WETH at current lower price via 1inch
- Profit (strike price - current price) √ó amount ‚Üí Option holder
- Purchased WETH ‚Üí LP (covers protocol liability)

**At Expiry (if unprofitable - price rose/stayed same):**
- Contract returns strike price USDC from original sale ‚Üí LP
- LP loses upside potential but gets premium + guaranteed USDC floor

**LP PUT Economics:** LP trades WETH upside potential for immediate premium + guaranteed USDC floor price

## üìä Market Dynamics

### Duration Competition
LPs compete on **daily cost efficiency**:
```
LP A: $45/day (1.5% daily yield)
LP B: $50/day (1.74% daily yield)  
LP C: $55/day (1.91% daily yield)

Takers naturally choose LP A for cost efficiency
```

### Yield Transparency
```sql
-- Real-time yield calculations
SELECT 
  lp_address,
  daily_premium_usdc / (amount * eth_price) * 100 as daily_yield_percent,
  daily_yield_percent * 365 as annualized_yield
FROM commitments 
ORDER BY daily_yield_percent DESC;
```

### Market Making Benefits
- **LP Competition**: Drives down costs for takers
- **Duration Flexibility**: Optimal capital efficiency
- **Risk Management**: 100% collateralization eliminates liquidations
- **Price Discovery**: Market-driven daily rates
